# Atlas Api

Atlas is a backend application i made using Nesjs, Prisma, Postgres, Jwt, Cloudinary, Docker and Swagger. I wanted to learn Nestjs and learn how authentication works from scratch in nestjs. All the authentication is writter from scratch. Also i generated docs with swagger and hosted images on Cloudinary. 

This Api has all the things you need in a hotel booking application for traveling. It also has admin api, where you can add new hotels, destinations and plans for whole day. You can write comments and create posts.
